The Atlantis Projects
---------------------

"Solving Complex Problems" is designed to provide students the opportunity to work as part of a team to design a viable solution to a complex problem that requires an interdisciplinary approach. For students participating in the Fall 2001 offering, the mission ("Mission 2005") is **to design permanent, manned, underwater research laboratories and to develop detailed research plans for the first six months of their operation.**

Because the design criteria for such laboratories depend greatly on the local submarine environment, Mission 2005 students are divided into two sections. The first is charged with designing a laboratory ("Atlantis I") situated on the Belize Barrier Reef Complex, the second longest barrier reef system in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The second section is charged with designing a laboratory ("Atlantis II") situated on the Edmond Hydrothermal Vent Field at a depth of over 3000 meters in the central Indian Ocean.
